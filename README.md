# DemoIdleGame

Hello, the reason for the delay in my demo project is that I am working in a busy job, although it is temporary. For this reason, I would like to state that I had to exceed the given time.

The most challenging part for me while doing the project was the components of the grid systems and ensuring they worked correctly. Due to the errors I received at some points, I had to change some points that were requested.
